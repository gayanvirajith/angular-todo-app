# Todo-app

A sample todo list application using AngularJS.

## How to install/run 

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. `npm install` - You need to have [node](http://nodejs.org/) install.
3. `gulp serve` - if you dont have gulp installed glabally. Install it first by
running `npm install -g gulp`. 
4. Open your favorite browswer and locate at 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

## Another way to run 

This is not the recommended way but, since it is just a html file you could open 
the `index.html` file using your favorite browser. But if you are using Chrome, 
make sure you disable same origin policy. You can do that by following this 
stack overflow post.
